This is a ros2 project that now contain customize diffrential drive plugin for gazebo-ros (I used the gazebo ros API to create this plugin) and it has a simple URDF xacro diffrential drive robot implemented properly 
* the teleop_keyboard node was created 
* This project is open for contribution and the sole aim is to develop it in more robust way. stay tunned until I implement diff algorithm for navigation and also concurently as time permits me, I should able to create a public repository for quadcopter and it control.
